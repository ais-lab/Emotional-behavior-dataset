# Emotional-behavior-dataset
A data set of six emotional behaviors lasting from 5 to 15 seconds.  
This can be used by unity. If you want to use this for unity, change the animation setting to Humanoid.  
The dataset was created as c3d files using a motion capture system and output as fbx format with motionbuilder.  
All motionfiles contain T-pose movements. If you use these, cut the beginning of the animation in unity.
